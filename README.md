# Zenon Network ZIP Aggregator

What is a ZIP? ZIP stands for Zenon Improvement Proposal. ZIP is a framework to provide structured facilitation of an idea to software upgrade.

ZIPs are fault tolerant. There is no central repository or editor who accepts or rejects ZIPs. They are proposed by the community to Pillars. If a Pillar supports a ZIP they will broadcast that support by publishing the ZIP on github, gitlab, IPFS, or some other public broadcast channel with a numbering system. If other Pillars support the iniative they will signal support by referencing the ZIP proposal in their own public broadcast channel. The Zenon community will maintain a "ZIP Pointer Service" repository which points to all the available ZIP broadcast channels supported by Pillars. This Pointer Service is centrally managed and provided as an administrative function by the Zenon community to make it easier to search all ZIPs.

This repository is the ZIP Pointer Service. In order to add a ZIP repository Pillars should submit a pull request.  ZIP repositories must meet the following criteria to be added:

1) The repository name should be ZIP.{PILLAR NAME}
2) ZIPs should be numbered starting with 0001
3) The first ZIP in the repository must indicate Proof of Pillar
4) Pillars that post spam ZIPs could be removed upon a network vote

## Proof of Pillar

- File Name: 0001.md
- Pillar Name: #INSERT
- Pillar Address: #INSERT
- Signed Message: Zenon Network is an Independent Entity
